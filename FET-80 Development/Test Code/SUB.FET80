# This code will subtract 123 from 36, and will return the result as a signed byte integer into the general purpose memory mapped IO location 0

# First, we need to invert the positive input with a NOT operation
# This is done using a NAND with the same 2 inputs
MOV A, 123
NAND A, A		# NOT(123) is in register A now
# Next, we do the addition on the 2 inputs, using the inverted version of the first
MOV B, 36
ADD A, B		# ADD(NOT(123), 36) is in A now
# Finally, we negate the output, to get subtraction!
NAND A, A		# NOT(ADD(NOT(123), 36)) is in A now, this is the same as SUB(123, 36)
# Now we just need to write it into the IO0 device memory register
MOV @IO0, A		# SUB(123, 36) is in M[IO0] now!
# Now do an infinite loop
(LOOP)
JMP LOOP		# Loop here forever, effectively a HALT()

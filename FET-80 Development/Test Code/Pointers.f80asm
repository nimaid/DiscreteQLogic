# This code is a demonstration of pointers
# We store a relative memory location (screen + offset), and change the contents from that memory location

# First, store the pointer address (upper right SCREEN area)
MOV @corner, SCREEN			# runs `MEM corner` first
ADD M, 16

# Now, set it so the upper right corner is on
MOV @@corner, 0b00000001	# runs `MEM corner` and `MEM M` first
# Then, set that pixel to off
MOV M, 0b00000000			# `M` is still set to the pointer

# Do an infinite loop to halt
(LOOP)

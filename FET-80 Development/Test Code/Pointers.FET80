# This code is a demonstration of pointers
# We store a relative memory location (screen + offset), and change the contents from that memory location

# First, store the pointer address (upper right SCREEN area)
MOV @corner, SCREEN
ADD @corner, 16

# Now, set it so the upper right corner is on
MOV @@corner, 0b00000001

# Now, set that pixel to off
MOV @@corner, 0b00000000
